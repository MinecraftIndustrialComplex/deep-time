### 2026-09-28 — P1-14, first pass: the deposit engine on synthetic fields (sub-agent of session f981c0d3-5144-49ec-8686-2946d755872c)
- **Scope.** Everything that does not need P1-03…P1-07: the data, the schema, the engine behind a
  named-field interface, a synthetic field history, the CLI path and the viewer. The row stays
  `doing` until the real history feeds it.
- **Data** (`crates/deeptime-core/data/usgs/*.json`, public-domain USGS, digitised by two Opus
  sub-agents with the report, table or figure, page and method of every number; placeholders say
  so). Porphyry Cu: OFR 2008-1155 Table 1 (PDF p. 9), n 422, 33 / 240 / 1,500 Mt, Cu 0.24 / 0.44 /
  **0.75** % (the research note's 0.80 was a figure tick), Mo, Au, Ag with reporting fractions,
  r(tonnage, Au) −0.28 and three more (text, PDF p. 8), 2 km rule (p. 4), density 4 / 15 / 35 per
  10⁵ km² (Singer, Berger & Menzie 2005, USGS record 70197200). MVT and SEDEX: OFR 2009-1252
  (Singer, Berger & Moring 2009) has **no MVT or SEDEX model**; its CAam (carbonate-hosted
  amagmatic, n 132, 93 of them MVT) and SHam (shale-hosted amagmatic, n 25, all SEDEX) models are
  used (Table 2 pp. 9–10), MVT-only SIR 2010-5070-A Table 1 and Bulletin 1693 31a/32a-b in `extra`.
  BIF: Bulletin 1693 model 34a (covers Algoma too), 11 / 170 / 2,400 Mt, Fe 30 / 53 / 66 %.
  Placer Au: Bulletin 1693 model 39a, 0.022 / 1.1 / 50 Mt, Au 0.084 / 0.2 / 0.48 g/t, 2.0 t/m³,
  1.6 km rule. Supergene: SIR 2010-5070-B facts (≤3× Andes, 0.4–1.7 % Cu, ≤200 m thick). Coal:
  Circular 891 densities and thickness limits (no USGS grade–tonnage model for coal exists; the
  4.2 / 13 / 25 Mt block is a placeholder). Petroleum: Waples 1980 TTI 15 / 75 / 160 (journal
  fact), field sizes from the DDS-60 Niger Delta assessment unit (2.4 / 12 / 89 MMBO, p90 and p10
  read off the histogram). **Not found anywhere (placeholders):** deposit densities per area for
  MVT, SEDEX, BIF, coal and oil; ore densities for porphyry, MVT, SEDEX, BIF; separations for BIF,
  coal, oil; a USGS table of reflectance by coal rank.
- **Deposit types** (datapack JSON, `neoforge/src/main/resources/data/deeptime/deeptime/deposit_type/`,
  compiled into the core): `porphyry_cu_mo_au` (children `supergene_cu_blanket`, `placer_au`),
  `bif_fe`, `coal_seam`, `mvt_zn_pb`, `sedex_zn_pb`, `petroleum_trap`. Schema
  `crates/deeptime-format/schema/deposit_type.schema.json` (a test compares its properties with the
  parser, which refuses unknown keys; another checks every non-placeholder number against its USGS
  table). Create stones as preferred hosts: serpentinite (veridium) 1.5 for copper, dolostone
  (asurine) 1.5 for MVT and SEDEX, banded_iron_formation (crimsite) 2.0 and the BIF sheet's own
  class, the porphyry gossan is ironstone (ochrum) and carries gold. `minecraft`: COE vein ids
  `createoreexcavation:ore_vein_type/{copper,gold,iron,coal,zinc}` (read from the COE 1.6.8 jar),
  `cdg_reservoir` for oil, `ore_block_policy` `ev_then_vanilla` (`none` for oil).
- **Engine** (`crates/deeptime-core/src/deposits/`, stage `deposits`): `fields` (the interface),
  `types`, `usgs`, `rules` (membership curves, product/min/geometric mean, host and clock scores,
  time integration F = 1 − Π(1 − F_t)^(Δt/τ), limiting component), `tracts`, `count` (Poisson,
  Voronoi provinces), `cluster` (Thomas positions, separation max(USGS rule, r_i + r_j)), `sizing`
  (split lognormal + Gaussian copula), `geometry`, `ledger`, `children` (supergene, placers),
  `petroleum` (Lopatin TTI, kitchens, charge in order), `playability`, `sites` (cause lookup),
  `synthetic`, `random` (xoshiro256++, PTRS Poisson). Pass 1 = one frame per step; the last step
  places, replays the frames at the chosen cells (pass 2: ledger, supergene windows) and writes
  sites, bodies and events. New `bodies/bodies.dtb` (`DTBD`, FORMAT.md "Bodies": 11 shape names on
  two metrics, zones by normalised distance and vertical position, erosion clip), written by
  `finalize_write`; `WorldState` gains `bodies` and `notes` (the census goes to `manifest.json`
  notes), checkpoint schema 2. Preset `{"deposits_synthetic": {…}}` (`session::Preset`).
- **CLI and viewer.** `deeptime stage deposits --preset <file> --viewer <dir>` (and `run`) print the
  census per type next to ρ·A·F; the viewer draws sites coloured by type on the keyframes (layers
  `deposits/favourability/<type>`, `deposits/sites`, `input/*`), a census table, and per site the
  component scores, weakest component, host rock, fate, the "Why here?" chain and a plan/section of
  its bodies (`report.js`; `index.html?site=<id>` opens a site).
- **Measured (Mac, `tools/remote/mac.sh`).** `cargo test --workspace` ok (core 82 of which 41
  `deposits::`, format 31, cli 11, jni 7, viewer 4, inspect 26); `cargo fmt --all -- -l` clean,
  `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean, `cargo deny check licenses bans` ok.
  `cargo run --release -p deeptime-cli -- stage deposits --preset
  crates/deeptime-core/tests/presets/deposits_synthetic_16k.json --viewer review/out/p1-deposits`
  (C 16,384, L1 1024 × 512, 50 frames of 10 Myr, strong provinces, count_mult 1): 52 steps, 32
  sites, 38 bodies, 110 events, 19.6 s wall and 0.83 GB peak footprint on the shared Mac.

  | type | ρ·A·F (§8.6) | drawn | sites | notes |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | porphyry_cu_mo_au | 9.41 | 9 | 6 | 1 buried, 4 truncated, 4 eroded; 1 guaranteed |
  | supergene_cu_blanket | — | — | 4 | over truncated porphyries in the dry arc |
  | placer_au | — | — | 2 | below eroded porphyries |
  | bif_fe | 2.50 | 4 | 5 | inherited, dated by the 2.2 Ga shelf-sea event; 1 guaranteed |
  | coal_seam | 9.69 | 8 | 10 | ranks from TTI; 2 guaranteed (exposed) |
  | mvt_zn_pb | 3.74 | 2 | 2 | |
  | sedex_zn_pb | 1.11 | 2 | 2 | |
  | petroleum_trap | 1.08 | 1 | 1 | charged 255 Myr ago by the rift kitchen |

  The pulled PNGs (`review/out/p1-deposits/keyframes/`) show the porphyry favourability on A's
  Andean arc, coal and MVT in B's foreland, SEDEX and oil in C's rift, BIF on C's craton; headless
  Chromium screenshots of `?site=` pages show the chains (placer ← exhumation ← erosion pulse,
  formation ← flare-up ← subduction onset; reservoir ← generation, subsidence, inversion).
- **Deviations from the plan.** (1) The acceptance run uses the synthetic preset file, not
  `earthlike_quick_16k` (which P1-03 creates). (2) The lognormal is split at the median so all
  three USGS percentiles are reproduced; its mean σ is the plan's (1.49 for porphyry). (3) Province
  endowments (lognormal, σ 0 / 0.35 / 0.7 / 1.2) redistribute a type's ρ·A·F between tracts and
  within them; they do not change the planet's expected count. (4) Iron is BIF only (no Fe skarn).
  (5) The essentials list comes from the preset until P1-15's `deeptime:essentials` registry;
  `guaranteed_occurrence` is emitted by the deposit stage (EVENTS.md updated). (6) Custom deposit
  types from datapacks are parsed by the same code but not yet passed in (the content bundle is not
  wired to the stage). (7) Causes are matched by point places (region masks arrive with P1-03).
  (8) The last frame's favourability is drawn one year before its end so the closing keyframe
  (sites) is a separate frame; a real pipeline that reaches the deposit stage at t = 0 needs a
  different trigger.
- **Field inputs the engine expects from P1-03…P1-07** (per L1 cell, per frame; frames oldest
  first, each standing for Δt years, **replayable** — pass 2 rereads them; `FieldHistory` in
  `deposits/fields.rs`, a `MemoryHistory` is there to record into):

  | field | units | provider |
  |---|---|---|
  | `deeptime:arc_magma_flux`, `deeptime:magma_oxidation` | 0–1 | P1-03 |
  | `deeptime:convergence_rate_km_myr`, `deeptime:obliquity_deg`, `deeptime:slab_age_myr` | km/Myr, °, Myr | P1-03 |
  | `deeptime:crust_thickness_km`, `deeptime:fault_density` | km, 0–1 | P1-03 |
  | `deeptime:orogenic_uplift_m_myr`, `deeptime:rift_subsidence_m_myr`, `deeptime:heat_flow_mw_m2` | m/Myr, m/Myr, mW/m² | P1-03 |
  | `deeptime:dist_litho_step_km` | km | P1-03 |
  | `deeptime:inherited_bif` | 0–1 | P1-03 (craton ages) + P1-07 |
  | `deeptime:elevation_m`, `deeptime:erosion_rate_m_myr`, `deeptime:deposition_rate_m_myr` | m, m/Myr | P1-04 |
  | `deeptime:topographic_gradient_m_km`, `deeptime:shelf` | m/km, 0–1 | P1-04 |
  | `deeptime:carbonate_platform`, `deeptime:evaporite`, `deeptime:euxinic_basin`, `deeptime:coal_facies` | 0–1 facies | P1-04 (strata log) |
  | `deeptime:source_rock_toc`, `deeptime:reservoir_quality`, `deeptime:seal` | wt%, 0–1 | P1-04 |
  | `deeptime:burial_temp_c` | °C of the organic layer | P1-04 + P1-07 |
  | `deeptime:trap_structure` | 0–1 closure | P1-07 |
  | `deeptime:water_table_depth_m` | m | P1-04 + P1-05 |
  | `deeptime:precip_mm`, `deeptime:t_mean_c` | mm/yr, °C | P1-05 |
  | `deeptime:host/<rock class>` | 0–1 fraction in the ore window | P1-07 (optional; absent = no lithology opinion) |
  | clocks `deeptime:clock/{oxygenated_oceans,land_plants,bif_acme}` | 0–1 per frame | the preset's `planet.atmosphere` (P1-03/P1-05) |
  | present-day drainage receivers (L1 cell → downstream cell) | — | P1-04 |

  Plus point-placed tectonic events for "Why here?" (`subduction_onset`, `collision`,
  `orogeny_phase`, `terrane_accretion`, `rift_onset`, `basin_subsidence`, `marine_transgression`,
  `erosion_pulse`) with t_start/t_end spanning the activity.
- **Not done.** Real-field integration (record frames in P1-03…P1-07, then a preset pipeline that
  ends with this stage); datapack content passed to the stage; Fe skarn; spawn ranking (§7.8);
  the Java side of bodies and its parity test (P1-15); size multipliers tuned on in-world renders
  (P1-15); merging placers that land on one drainage cell (the second is dropped by separation);
  a spacesheep review page. Tuning note: time integration saturates F near 1 inside long-lived
  systems (mean F 0.87–0.98), so counts follow ρ·A and favourability mostly shapes tracts.
- **Next step.** P1-03…P1-07 publish their fields as frames (`FieldHistory`); then point the
  real preset's pipeline at `DepositStage` and rerun the acceptance on `earthlike_quick_16k`.

### 2026-09-28 — P1-01 (sub-agent of session f981c0d3-5144-49ec-8686-2946d755872c)
- **Formats** (`crates/deeptime-format`, spec in `FORMAT.md` and the new `EVENTS.md`). Every new
  binary file is one "sectioned file" (`container.rs`): the §5.7.2 16-byte header, per-type fixed
  fields, a section table (u64 offset, u32 length, u32 CRC32) and 8-byte-aligned sections.
  `DTEV` event segments `events/<writer>-<n>.dtev` (string table, 64-byte records sorted by
  (t_start, id), causes, 16-byte typed params, a 64-record time index) + `events/index.json`
  (writers, segments with first/last seq, t range, bytes, CRC); `EventWriter` continues a writer's
  numbering from the index and `clear()`s only its own segments on a re-run; `EventLog` merges all
  writers and indexes by time, kind, cause (reverse links, `cause_chain`) and L1 cell. `DTSR` site
  records (104 bytes) + `DTSI` 512-block grid (CSR, x wraps). `DTKF` keyframes (RGBA8 per layer,
  LZ4 block) + `keyframes/index.json`. `ramps.rs`: the one colour code for ramps.json (core
  keyframes and viewer). Format version stays 0.0; no existing file's bytes changed.
- **Core.** `stage.rs` (Stage: name, estimate, total/steps_done, `step(world, ctx)` with the
  deadline in `ctx.until`, keyframe_layers, `save_state`/`load_state` — the plan's `checkpoint(w)`
  is split so the session builds checkpoints), `world.rs` (`WorldState`: clock, named f32 fields,
  events as writer 1, sites), `dummy.rs` (the dummy preset grows optional `stages` and `world`: a
  drifting continent, a causal event chain, deposit sites; without them it is exactly P0-07's),
  `keyframes.rs` (render with ramps, ring of 16, every frame on disk at once, dropped frames read
  back), `checkpoint.rs` (`DTCP`: JSON summary + postcard 1.1.3 body; schema constant). The session
  runs a list of stages, publishes events for `eventsSince` (cursor = count in emission order),
  takes keyframes on an interval grid counted from the run's start and at each stage end, resumes
  from checkpoints (mid-stage too; a resumed run ends in the identical world — unit test), and
  `finalize_write` writes preset.json, events, sites, keyframes/index.json and the standard
  `Manifest` last (source `run:dummy`, every file listed with size and CRC).
- **CLI.** `run --preset --out [--viewer] [--checkpoints]`, `stage <name> (--in|--preset) [--out]
  [--viewer]` (refuses a stage the checkpoint already ran), `bench --preset --threads --out
  [--viewer]` (per-stage ms incl. keyframes, finalize, peak bytes from a counting allocator).
- **Viewer.** Keyframe strip, scrubber with play, event ticker (events up to the frame, new ones
  bold), site list, details with params, causes/effects and the "Why here?" chain; markers on the
  frame; `events.json`/`sites.json`; the layer map hides itself when a bundle has no layers.
  Bench page: per-thread-count bars on one scale + table. Checked in headless Chromium.
- **Measured (Mac, `tools/remote/mac.sh`).** `cargo test -p deeptime-format` 27 passed;
  `cargo run -p deeptime-cli -- run --preset crates/deeptime-core/tests/presets/dummy.json --out
  $TMPDIR/p1-01/dummy --viewer review/out/p1-dummy` → 2 stages, 13 events, 9 keyframes, 3 sites,
  peak 1.5 MiB, 0.19 s; `cargo test --workspace` (core 41 incl. P1-02's 23, format 27, cli 10, jni 7, viewer 4),
  `fmt --check`, `clippy -D warnings`, `deny check licenses bans` clean; `gradlew build test`
  tests=34 failures=0 on master 2f81ae5 + this branch (NativeLinkTest gains
  `keyframesAndEventsCrossTheBoundary`);
  `mac.sh --server -- ./gametest.sh` → All 14 required tests passed (NativeGameTests
  `dummySessionRunsAndCancels`: steps=5 manifest ok, cancelled run wrote no manifest). Bench of the
  dummy (debug build): stages 36.7 ms at 1 thread → 7.7 ms at 8.
- **Contract changes to note.** The session's `manifest.json` is now the standard `Manifest`
  (P0-07 wrote an ad-hoc one; Java only ever checked `format_version`). `estimate` lists every
  stage (`{"peak_bytes":0,"stages":[{"bytes":0,"name":"dummy","seconds":0.0}]}`; NativeLinkTest
  updated). `keyframeInfo`/`copyKeyframe` are wired: `UnsupportedOperationException` only when the
  preset makes no keyframes (the Phase 0 dummy), `IllegalArgumentException` for an index not yet
  produced or a short/heap buffer. New `CoreError::{InvalidArgument, Format}` (JNI maps them to
  `IllegalArgumentException` and `DeepTimeIoException`).
- **Not done / later.** Region and path places are not cell-indexed (masks and paths are stored
  from P1-03); geology writes its events as one segment at `finalizeWrite` (no streaming yet);
  `run --data <jar|dir>` is `--content <file>` until P1-07; the kinds table in `EVENTS.md` reserves
  every v1 kind with "params set by P1-xx".
- **Longitude.** Events, sites, keyframes and the dummy world use plan §5.2's longitude
  360°·(x + C/2)/C (the seam is 0°), as P1-02's coupling and master's viewer do.

### 2026-09-28 — P0-11 `deeptime-inspect` (sub-agent of session f981c0d3-5144-49ec-8686-2946d755872c)
- **Created.** `crates/deeptime-inspect` (lib + binary): region files (4 KiB sectors; gzip, zlib,
  raw and lz4-java `LZ4Block` chunks; external `.mcc`), an in-crate NBT reader, 1.21 sections
  (palette + packed longs), heightmaps and structure pieces, and a small zip reader for jars.
  Subcommands `colors`, `topdown`, `rock`, `ore`, `section`, `seam`, `regions`, `compare`, plus
  `column` (one column's blocks) and `fixture` (copies chunks into a new region file). New deps,
  all MIT/Apache: clap, flate2, lz4_flex, png, memmap2. Fixture: chunks 4..=9 × 0..=3 of the
  standalone smoke world, 389 KB (`tests/fixtures/world/region/r.0.0.mca`).
- **Gap 18 (compare made machine-checkable; plan §9.7 and P0-11 updated).** Measured = the
  highest block that is not air, fluid or a feature (vegetation, logs, wood, leaves, roots, huge
  mushrooms, coral, sea pickles, snow layers, sheet ice, …): `OCEAN_FLOOR` minus logs, leaves and
  features. Expected = `⌈H⌉ − 1` (bilinear `elevation`, the GameTests' value). Full chunks only;
  excluded and counted: `structure` (12 blocks around pieces reaching the surface) and `carved`
  (2 columns around a pit ≥ 2 blocks below close₃₂(open₄(measured)); reads only the measured
  surface). A first rule (air/fluid under neighbours' surfaces) missed vertical ravines and smooth
  dry cave-entrance hollows on beaches (17 blocks deep, no overhang), hence the morphological
  test. `section` prints `water_top_y=<y> water_block_y=<y−1> columns=<n>`, `water_top_y` being
  the top face of the highest water block as P0-13's `lakeHolds` defines it. On P0-13's GameTest
  world (main checkout's Mac copy) `section --world run-gametest/world/dimensions/deeptime/test_lake
  --axis z --at 0 --from -88 --to 212` → `water_top_y=120 water_block_y=119 columns=209`.
- **Measured** (Mac; `install.sh standalone --synth wrap-test --size 16384 && run.py --profile
  standalone --fresh --chunky 128 --chunky-seam` → PASS): compare p99 1, p50 0, max 5,
  histogram −3:9 −2:145 −1:2478 0:105190 +1:1106 +2:124 +3:85 +4:35 +5:12; excluded carved
  11,792 (9.2 %), structure 7,024 (5.5 %). Renders in `review/out/p0-11/` (Mac and laptop,
  gitignored); the colour table from the client-extra jar + the 6 standalone jars resolves 1,836
  blocks.
- **Findings.** (1) With aquifers on, the ocean floor carries aquifer-barrier stone (then sand)
  2–6 blocks above H, and geodes poke through it: 0.2 % of the world's columns, 4 % in the
  fixture's patch. (2) The game creates 0-byte region files beyond the seam (r.16.*, r.−17.*)
  when it merely looks chunks up; TW folds every write. `run.py` now records them
  (`outside_empty`) instead of failing the span check; `regions` does the same. (3) `run.py
  --chunky-seam` pregenerates x ∈ [C/2 − 144, C/2) and [−C/2, −C/2 + 144), z ∈ [−64, 80): Chunky's
  square is `(int) centre >> 4 ± ceil(radius / 16)` chunks.
- **Limits.** The pit test would also drop real hollows narrower than 64 blocks (rivers, P2);
  `rock` maps blocks through the `#deeptime:rock/*` tags until `/deeptime probe palette` exists;
  format 0.0 has no site bodies to overlay. Next: P0-13 uses `section`, P0-14/15 the renders.

### 2026-09-28 — P0-13 (sub-agent of session f981c0d3-5144-49ec-8686-2946d755872c)
- **Created.** `worldgen/WaterPass` (after `StrataPass` in `buildSurface`; fills air below the water
  surface down to the ground with water sources through `ProtoChunk.setBlockState`, so the worldgen
  heightmaps stay current and no fluid tick or post-processing mark is made), `worldgen/WaterLevels`
  (plain-Java level lookup, JUnit-tested on the lake fixture), the gametest level `deeptime:test_lake`
  (folder `deeptime-lake`, C 1024, `planet_nocaves`, fixed biome `deeptime:test_bare`: no carvers, no
  features, temperature 0.8), `WaterGameTests.lakeHolds`; `gametest.sh` also writes
  `synth --kind lake-test --size 1024`.
- **Measured** (Mac, `tools/remote/mac.sh --server -- './gametest.sh'` → All 14 required tests passed):
  `[gametest] lakeHolds before=65304 after=65304 expected=65304 outside=0 outsideAtGeneration=0
  columns=7299 shoreColumns=2 reach=4 woken=65304 ticks=400 generatedFluidTicks=0
  pendingFluidTicksAfter=0 analytic=66062 floorCornerMaxDiff=0 cornerColumns=442 chunks=240` and
  `[gametest] lakeHolds water_top_y=120 at=(0, 0) top_water_block_y=119 floor_y=109` (gap 18's
  printed value; the plan's P0-13 acceptance now names it and fills in the section's z and x range).
  lakeHolds takes ~20 s (240 forceloaded chunks generated synchronously, then 400 ticks). JUnit
  tests=33 failures=0.
- **The test is stricter than the plan's:** after the first count it schedules a fluid tick on every
  water source it counted (as a changed neighbour would), so "after" proves the basin is watertight,
  not only that nothing ticked. `expected` is every open block (air or water) between each footprint
  column's ground and its surface; `outside` is any water in a box 48 blocks past the footprint,
  y 84…141, that is not in those blocks. `floorCornerMaxDiff=0` ties the basin to the raster at
  noise-cell corners; `analytic` is the same count from the raster's H (informational: bilinear
  interpolation over 4-block noise cells moves the shore by a block or two).
- **Shore rule (contradicts nothing in the plan; a new bake requirement).** The first run failed with
  `outside=2`: two shore columns (27,33)/(33,27) at d = 2.64 had ground 118 under the surface 120
  (raster H 119.89), but their nearest `water_level` cell (28,34) sits at d = 4.05, outside the synth's
  wet ring (d ≤ 4); the woken lake turned those pockets into new sources. Generated ground is the
  density interpolated bilinearly over 4-block noise cells, so on a steep shore it lies below the
  raster. `WaterLevels.levelAt` therefore gives a dry-celled column the level of the nearest wet cell
  within one noise cell (`reach` = the settings' cell width, 4); only air below the level is ever
  filled, so this adds no water on ground above the level. **Phase 2's bake must keep each basin's
  rim above its level for at least one noise cell (4 blocks) beyond the last wet cell.**
- **Ice (plan §7.9) is not placed by WaterPass:** vanilla's `freeze_top_layer` feature, present in
  every overworld biome, freezes the top water block where the biome is cold, and the lake exists
  before features run. A `SpreadingSnowyDirtBlock` (grass, mycelium) left under the water by the
  surface rules becomes dirt, as vanilla's underwater rule would make it (its random tick would
  otherwise do so later and wake the water).
- **Not run:** `./gametest.sh -PwithMic` (a pack biome modifier that targets every biome could give
  `test_bare` features); the `deeptime-inspect section` PNG waits for P0-11.
- **Next.** P0-11's `section --world run-gametest/world/dimensions/deeptime/test_lake --axis z --at 0
  --from -88 --to 212` for the review picture.

### 2026-09-28 — P0-08 (sub-agent of session f981c0d3-5144-49ec-8686-2946d755872c)
- **Created.** `tools/natives/build-natives.sh` (`nix run .#natives`; the app re-enters the dev
  shell so build scripts get a host linker on macOS too): cargo-zigbuild for Linux (gnu at `.2.17`)
  and macOS, cargo-xwin for Windows, then per-file checks (ELF/PE/Mach-O machine, musl NEEDED and
  GLIBC, gnu floor ≤ 2.17, macOS minos ≤ 11.7.1 and `/usr/lib`-only dylibs, no `target-cpu` in
  RUSTFLAGS) and `natives.json` (schema 1, same fields and glibc scan as `hostNatives`). Gradle
  `-Prelease` packs `target/natives-dist` after `checkReleaseNatives` (exactly the eight keys,
  size + sha256 per file, version/format equal to Cargo.toml, no stray files; clear message if
  missing). `.github/workflows/natives.yml`: build job (natives + release jar, both uploaded) and
  eight `NativeSmoke` load jobs against the release jar, each also asserting `platform=<its key>`.
- **Measured on the Mac** (`tools/remote/mac.sh -- 'nix run .#natives'`, then readelf/file):
  `file` → 2 PE32+ (x86-64, ARM64), 2 Mach-O (x86_64, arm64), 4 ELF (2 x86-64, 2 aarch64); musl
  NEEDED `libc.so` only (no `libgcc_s`: zig links the unwinder); gnu x86_64 and aarch64 highest
  `GLIBC_2.17`; `./gradlew build -Prelease` → 8 libraries in the jar, tests=30 failures=0, and
  NativeSmoke on that jar on the Mac → `status=OK … platform=macos-aarch64`.
- **CI** ([run 36492319610](https://github.com/MinecraftIndustrialComplex/deep-time/actions/runs/36492319610),
  first attempt): every job success; each load job printed `status=OK version=0.0.1 format=0.0
  selftest=1997318690096807936` with its own platform key (windows-x86_64, windows-aarch64 on
  `windows-11-arm`, macos-aarch64, macos-x86_64, linux-{x86_64,aarch64}-gnu, and
  linux-{x86_64,aarch64}-musl in Alpine). Cold build job 25 min (natives 18, Gradle 5); caches
  are saved now. `workflow_dispatch` returns 404 until natives.yml is on master, so the bring-up
  used a temporary push trigger on branch `p0-08-natives` (reverted).
- **Contradicts the plan (now §6.4 "Measured in P0-08").** macOS natives use cargo-zigbuild on the
  Mac as well: a plain `cargo build` in the Nix shell linked `/nix/store/…/libiconv.2.dylib`. zig
  0.13 sets minos 11.7.1 on both macOS libraries. The dylibs get install name
  `@rpath/libdeeptime_jni.dylib` (`.cargo/config.toml`). Windows DLLs import `VCRUNTIME140.dll`
  (the JVM loads it itself; no static CRT). cargo-xwin is 0.23.1 in nixpkgs and CI. cargo-xwin's
  README asks only for clang and "LLVM tools"; the shell's clang-cl, lld-link and llvm-lib suffice.
- **Next.** Merge; after natives.yml is on master, `gh workflow run natives.yml` works as written.
  Actions still warns that checkout/cache/setup-java/artifact @v4 run on Node 20 (forced to 24).


### 2026-09-28 — P1-02 L0 geometry (agent worktree agent-ab52c5f47be5db0ae)
- **What.** `crates/deeptime-core/src/sphere/{mod,fibonacci,hull,kdtree,coupling}.rs` and
  `crates/deeptime-core/examples/sphere_bench.rs`. New deps in deeptime-core only: glam 0.33.11 and
  kiddo 6.3.0 (default features off, `multi-threaded` on, which drops `fixed`), both MIT OR
  Apache-2.0; `cargo deny check licenses bans` → ok. Nothing ported, so NOTICE.md is unchanged.
- **Hull algorithm.** Randomized incremental 3D convex hull with conflict buckets (Clarkson & Shor
  1989; de Berg et al. 2008 ch. 11; the bucketing of Guibas, Knuth & Sharir 1992), inserted in a
  BRIO order (Amenta, Choi & Rote 2003), expected O(n log n). Exact predicates: coordinates snapped
  to multiples of 2⁻³⁸ (≤ 3.2e-12 movement), orientation by a float evaluation with Shewchuk's
  stage-A bound and an i128 fallback. Duplicates are skipped and listed (`skipped()`); cocircular
  sets (cube, octahedron) triangulate; point sets that do not surround the centre fail with
  `NotCovering`. Point location is a stochastic visibility walk; barycentrics are gnomonic (ray from
  the centre to the face plane).
- **Measured** with `tools/remote/mac.sh -- 'cargo build --release -p deeptime-core --example
  sphere_bench && ./target/release/examples/sphere_bench [--threads 1 250000]'` (M6 Mac mini, 12
  threads, min of 3): 250k samples → Fibonacci 0.2 ms, **hull 255 ms** (280 ms on 1 thread; the
  hull is sequential), k-d tree 7.8 ms, L1 coupling 12 ms at 1024×512 and 41 ms at 2048×1024
  (98 / 351 ms on 1 thread); 100k → hull 98 ms, tree 2.9 ms, coupling 10 / 36 ms. V − E + F = 2,
  nothing skipped, 0 bad cells on all four presets' L1 grids. BRIO saves ~6% over a plain shuffle
  (254 vs 270 ms, A/B in one session). Next to Cortial's Table 2 (1.24 s per regular step at 250k),
  re-triangulating at every resampling is cheap.
- **Conventions fixed in `coupling.rs`.** λ = 360°·(x + C/2)/C ∈ [0°, 360°) (§5.2; the seam
  x = −C/2 is λ = 0), φ = −360°·z/C (north is −z), v = (cos φ cos λ, cos φ sin λ, sin φ) with +Z
  the north pole and +X the seam meridian; raster cells are `GridDesc` point samples (row 0 = north
  pole). **Differs from existing code:** the viewer's inspector (`viewer.js` `inspect`) prints
  longitude 360°·x/C (seam at ±180°), and `AnalyticTestTerrain` uses θ = 2πx/C and φ = πz/(C/2)
  (+z north). Both are a constant 180° longitude shift (and, for the test terrain, a latitude sign
  that its |φ|/cos φ formulas never see); align the viewer's label when it next changes.
- **Coupling layout.** `CellLink { tri, nearest, w: [f32; 3] }`, 20 B per cell (42 MB at
  2048×1024). `Coupling::refresh(mesh, tree, stale)` re-links only the cells a predicate marks;
  P1-03 supplies "the cell's triangle left its plate". `interpolate` (barycentric) and
  `categorical` (nearest sample) sample L0 fields onto the grid.
- **Tests** (`cargo test -p deeptime-core sphere::`, 23 tests, 3.1 s debug): Euler and exact
  local-Delaunay/neighbour checks on Fibonacci 12…100k and 10k random points, a brute-force
  convexity check, degenerate sets, every L1 cell of the 16k-quick ladder (100k samples,
  1024×512), k-d nearest against brute force on 10,000 random points (100k Fibonacci and 20k random
  samples), and property tests for block ↔ lat/lon ↔ unit vector (round trips, x wraps at ±C/2,
  the columns either side of the seam one block apart).
- **Next.** P1-03 (plates) builds on `SphereMesh`, `SampleTree` and `Coupling`.

### 2026-09-28 (later) — builds moved to the Mac; P0-06 shaping; P0-07 and P0-09 merged
- **Builds run on Ben's M6 Mac mini** (his instruction, after parallel builds overloaded the laptop):
  `tools/remote/mac.sh` rsyncs the checkout to `/Volumes/Graphide/ban/mic/mods/<name>` on the external
  SSD and runs the command inside a GC-rooted dev-shell profile there (never a fresh flake eval per call:
  that pattern filled the Mac's SSD twice). Host native on the Mac: `macos-aarch64`.
- **Toroidal World shaping (P0-06).** TW's `ShapeModule` path runs only from its Create World button
  and never on a dedicated server (TW 0.19.3 source, `client/shape/mixin/CreateWorldScreenMixin`), so
  Deep Time shapes its own worlds from `WorldDimensions.bake` (`WorldDimensionsShapeMixin` →
  `wrap/PlanetShape`) with TW's public `ShapeDimensions.withSpans`: X loops over C/16 chunks, Nether
  1:8, End unlooped. Verified on a dedicated planet server: stamped, loopsX, not loopsZ, 1024 chunks.
  TW's climate compression matches vanilla climate functions only, so it never applies to Deep Time's.
- **GameTest naming.** With `@PrefixGameTestTemplate(false)` a test is named by its lower-case method
  name without the class prefix, so `/test runall <class>` finds nothing; the planet harness runs
  tests by name (`--run name1,name2@x,y,z`).
- **MIC in dev runs (`-PwithMic`).** Sinytra Connector cannot start in a ModDevGradle dev run ("Could
  not determine clean minecraft artifact path"), so dev runs leave out Connector, Fabric-only jars and
  whatever hard-requires them (antique-atlas, surveyor); Distant Horizons 3.3.0 casts the server to
  `DedicatedServer` and crashes the GameTest server, so it is in `tools/smoke/profiles/mic.gametest-excluded`.
  Production-launched smoke servers keep the whole pack. `linkRunMods` links one of two byte-identical
  jars (as FML does) and fails only on differing duplicates.
- **Pack findings for Ben** (the pack is not modified; decisions log 2026-09-28: Deep Time changes to
  MIC go on a pack branch):
  1. `index.toml` at 303fd89 has a stale hash for `kubejs/server_scripts/destroy_metallurgy_integration.js`,
     so packwiz-installer rejects the pack ("Hash invalid!").
  2. Ritchie's Projectile Library is pinned twice (`mods/rpl.pw.toml` and
     `mods/ritchies-projectile-library.pw.toml`, same 2.1.2 jar under two names).
  3. `index.toml` lists three raw jars that `.gitignore` keeps out of git (`mods/destroy-1.21.1-0.4.1.jar`,
     `mods/Dice-neoforge-1.0.0.jar`, `mods/playingcards-2.0.1-neoforge.jar`): they exist only in the
     laptop's working tree, so a fresh clone of the pack cannot install. `install.sh mic` copies them
     from the working tree into its snapshot.
- **The Mac has no real git** (`/usr/bin/git` is Apple's stub): `mac.sh` keeps a GC-rooted nixpkgs git
  on the SSD, and the dev shell carries git.
- **P0-10.** `WorldDataTerrain` reads the world data through `ActiveWorldData`, filled by
  `WorldDataBinder` at `ServerAboutToStartEvent` (HIGHEST) for every Deep Time stem without a test
  terrain. `StrataPass` v0 paints horizon stacks over stone/deepslate after the pack's surface rules;
  `RockPalette` v0 takes the first member of `#deeptime:rock/<class>` (Deep Time ships the 20 vanilla
  entries of the MIC rock tags). `SpawnHandler` takes the first spawn candidate that is dry land.
- **Seam tests need TW's rules:** TW folds a non-player entity at the end of its own server tick
  (`ServerLevelMixin.tickNonPassenger` TAIL), so a test entity must move under its own motion; and a
  position past the edge must be folded with `ToroidalShape.fold` before use. A synchronous load of a
  seam chunk from a test can wait indefinitely in TW's seam-generation queue, so seam tests read only
  forceloaded chunks (`getChunkNow`). Two `/test run` at one position cancel each other: the harness
  spaces tests 8 blocks apart.
- **TW semantics for tests:** TW moves an entity that *steps* over the border (its movement path);
  `setPos` is a teleport and stays unfolded.
- **P0-07 (agent, merged):** see the P0-07 entry below. **P0-09 (agent, merged):** on-disk layout in
  `crates/deeptime-format/FORMAT.md`; climate layers are named after the router fields
  (`climate/{temperature,vegetation,continents,erosion,ridges}`); lake-test geometry in its manifest
  `notes.lake`; no `bodies/` yet.

### 2026-09-28 — P0-01 to P0-05 (session f981c0d3-5144-49ec-8686-2946d755872c)
- **Repo.** Created `MinecraftIndustrialComplex/deep-time` (private) and moved the docs in; `mic/Docs`
  now holds pointers. Dev shell builds (cargo-zigbuild with zig 0.13 is rebuilt on XiaServer the
  first time). nixpkgs now carries cargo-xwin 0.23.1, not 0.22.0 as the plan says.
- **Toroidal World is a bundle.** Its Modrinth file is a `lowcodefml` jar carrying the NeoForge and
  Fabric builds as jar-in-jar; the NeoForge build (`toroidal_world`, API `com.toroidalworld.api.v1`)
  nests MixinSquared. Gradle therefore compiles against the extracted inner jar
  (`extractToroidalWorld`) and every run loads the bundle from its `mods/` folder (`linkRunMods*`),
  exactly as players install it. `localRuntime` carries nothing.
- **Smoke.** `standalone` boots in about 30 s, peak RSS 1.97 GB; `mic` (168 server jars) boots in
  about 290 s, peak RSS 4.26 GB. TW compat configs that applied in MIC: aeronautics, c2me, create,
  distanthorizons, lithium, sable, simpleclouds. TW mixins count as recorded, not required: 235 of
  278 applied by `Done (` in MIC; the rest target classes an idle server never loads.
- **Pack finding.** The MIC pack's committed `index.toml` (303fd89) has a stale hash for
  `kubejs/server_scripts/destroy_metallurgy_integration.js`, so packwiz-installer rejects the pack
  from HEAD as well as from the working tree. `install.sh mic` installs from a snapshot re-indexed
  with `packwiz refresh` and records every hash it had to fix (`smoke/mic/install.json`).
- **Router design (plan §7.1 deviation, implementation detail).** The router is Deep Time's own
  noise settings (`deeptime:planet`, `deeptime:planet_nocaves`), generated from vanilla's by
  `tools/dev/gen_worldgen.py`, rather than derived in Java from the pack's `minecraft:overworld`
  (Tectonic replaces that router in MIC). Per-level binding (review 2, gap 4): the generator overrides
  `generatorSettings()` with a lazily bound copy whose `deeptime:*` functions read that level's
  terrain source; `ChunkMap` builds the level's `RandomState` from it. The surface rule is
  `deeptime:delegate` → the pack's `minecraft:overworld` rule, resolved when applied. Slides:
  −352→−328 and 624→640 (gap 8). `planet_nocaves` also has aquifers off: with them on, a local
  aquifer put barrier stone 3 blocks above an ocean floor and moved the measured surface.
- **GameTests.** The GameTest-server mixin passes only `deeptime:*` datapack stems (gap 9);
  `heightMatchesReference` max difference 0 on all 128 columns; `periodicAcrossSeam` 0 mismatches.
- **Blocker fix (gap 1).** `DeepTimeTestReporter` logs `[gametest-result]` lines on the planet
  server, and `/deeptime gametest summary` prints `[gametest-summary]` JSON that
  `gametest-planet.sh` polls.

### 2026-09-28 — P0-07 (sub-agent of session f981c0d3-5144-49ec-8686-2946d755872c)
- **Built and measured on the Mac mini** (`tools/remote/mac.sh`), so the host native there is
  `macos-aarch64` / `libdeeptime_jni.dylib` (1,055,136 bytes). `cargo test --workspace`, clippy
  `-D warnings`, `fmt --check`, `deny check licenses bans` all ok; `gradlew build test` →
  `tests=18 failures=0 errors=0` (NativeLoaderTest 9, NativeLinkTest 4, PlatformKeyTest 4, Sanity 1);
  `java -cp <jar> tools/natives/NativeSmoke.java <fresh dir>` → `status=OK version=0.0.1 format=0.0
  selftest=1997318690096807936`, and each forcing property → `status=FAILED class=<its class>`,
  exit 0 every time. The Linux paths (PT_INTERP, gnu/musl order, glibc floor scan) are unit-tested
  with synthetic ELF files and a Groovy check; CI's ubuntu Gradle job is their first real run.
- **The five failure classes and their guidance** (`FailureClass.guidance`, plan §6.6):
  - `UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORM`: "Deep Time has no native library that runs on this platform (<key>).
    Existing Deep Time worlds still play. To create a new one, run `deeptime run` (the Deep Time CLI)
    on a supported machine and copy its deeptime/ folder into the world folder."
  - `LIBC_MISMATCH`: "The native library needs a C library this system does not provide (<error>).
    Install the musl build, or update glibc (the floor is 2.17)." + the CLI route.
  - `ANTIVIRUS_SUSPECTED`: "The extracted native library vanished or changed between writing and
    loading, which is what antivirus quarantine looks like. Add an exclusion for <dir>, or start the
    game with -Ddeeptime.natives.path=<a copy of the library>."
  - `IO_ERROR`: "Could not create, lock, write or move files in <dir> (<exception>). Check that the
    folder is writable and the disk has space."
  - `VERSION_MISMATCH`: "The native library does not match this Deep Time (<what differs>).
    Reinstall the mod; a stray -Ddeeptime.natives.path library is the usual cause."
- **Implementation details.** `natives.json` schema 1 is now in plan §6.5 (gap 14); the format
  version's one source is `Cargo.toml` `[workspace.metadata.deeptime]`, read by `deeptime-format`'s
  new `build.rs` and by Gradle with the same line scan. `NativeLoader` is JDK-only (gap 13): a
  built-in JSON reader (`MiniJson`) and a `NativeLogSink` callback that `DeepTime` points at SLF4J.
  `forkEvery = 1` is on `test` (gap 17), so CI's single results folder holds everything; the fourth
  extraction case is four concurrent extractions into one directory (exactly one writes).
  jni-rs 0.22.4 matched the plan's sketch (`EnvUnowned`, `with_env`, `resolve::<P>()`); the policy's
  `Captures` must be `()` for `resolve`. Extra entry-point rules: `drainLog(0)` drains the
  process-wide ring; `destroy` and `drainLog` still work on a poisoned session. The dummy preset
  takes two optional test keys, `reserve_bytes` (memory cap) and `panic_at_step` (panic guard).
  `SimSession.start` creates the native session on the caller's thread so a bad preset throws at
  once; the worker thread advances, finalizes and destroys. `serde_json` joins the workspace.
- **Next.** Ben runs `./gametest.sh` for `NativeGameTests` (log line
  `[gametest] native version=… format=… target=… selftest=…`); then P0-08.

## Known issues and open questions
- The plan is at revision 2 plus a partial revision 3 (the decisions-log rule in §1.2). The 29 gaps of
  docs/plan-reviews/2026-09-28-cold-read-review-2.md are fixed in the plan by the task that hits each
  one; the build log names each fix as it lands.
